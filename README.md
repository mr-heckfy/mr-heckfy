Hi, Iâ€™m heckfy
I'm working with my friends on a game project. I want to create an interesting, challenging, exciting game with the ability to control the plot myself :)
In our group at the moment 1 programmer (me) and 1 artist (we need more). We are working leisurely, since we are only 9th grade students. Self-taught students who want to create their own project. Will be glad to see people like us, because we work slowly and just learn.
